How many more wrappers than bottle caps did danny find at the park?", "answer": "To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny found at the park, we need to compare the number of wrappers and bottle caps he found. Danny found 65 wrappers and 5 bottle caps at the park. Therefore, Danny found 65 - 5 = 60 more wrappers than bottle caps.\nThe answer is 60."}, {"question": "Faye was placing her pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row. She had 6 packs of pencils each one having 14 pencils. How many pencils does she have?", "answer": "First, we need to determine the total number of pencils Faye had. Since she had 6 packs with 14 pencils each, the total number of pencils is 6 x 14 = 84 pencils.\nNext, we need to determine how many rows she can make with the pencils she has. To do this, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each row. 84 pencils / 22 pencils per row = 3.7 rows.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a row, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Faye could make 4 rows.\nThe answer is 4."}, {"question": "Danny collects bottle caps. He lost 66 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 25 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?", "answer": "To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to subtract the number of bottle caps he lost from the total number of bottle caps he now has. Danny lost 66 bottle caps and now has 25 bottle caps. Therefore, Danny had 66 - 25 = 41 bottle caps at first.\nThe answer is 41."}]
