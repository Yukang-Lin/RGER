(by #6 #3) Step 1: Analyze the impact of the embargo on trade goods.\nThe introduction of an embargo on foreign trade goods causes a sharp decrease in exports.\n#8. (by #4 #7) Step 2: Analyze the impact of falling exports on the national currency.\nIf exports fall sharply, this country's national currency cannot be strong.\n#9. (by #5) Step 3: Analyze the relationship between inflation control and a strong national currency.\nInflation control is required to have a strong national currency.\n#10. (by #8 #9) Step 4: Combine the relationship between falling exports, the national currency, and inflation control.\nIf exports fall sharply and the national currency cannot be strong, then it implies that inflation control is not successful.\n#11. (by #10 #2) Step 5: Analyze the relationship between exchange rate regulation, inflation control, and effective monetary policy.\nA country cannot simultaneously regulate the exchange rate and successfully control inflation.\nTherefore, if inflation control is not successful, effective monetary policy is not possible.\n#12. (by #6 #11) Step 6: Determine the possibility of effective monetary policy in Russia.\nThere is an embargo on Russian foreign trade goods, which leads to falling exports and a weak national currency.\nSince the falling exports imply unsuccessful inflation control, according to our analysis (step 11), effective monetary policy is not possible in Russia.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"In Russia, an effective monetary policy is possible\" is False.", "ctxs": [320], "ctxs_candidates": [[320], [322], [321], [877], [876], [875], [117], [582], [277], [927], [119], [275], [276], [581], [190], [192], [274], [312], [482], [241], [583], [680], [8], [118], [240], [956], [580], [679], [177], [905], [43], [101], [161], [105], [961], [563], [222], [907], [357], [723], [102], [461], [871], [606], [459], [212], [311], [629], [103]]}, {"story_id": 143, "premises": "Video Gag is a French television series that airs weekly.\nVideo Gag airs on the French broadcast channel TF1. \nIf viewers send funny videos to the French broadcast channel TF1, then Video Gag airs them weekly.\nAll videos aired on Video Gag are in French.", "premises-FOL": "FrenchTelevision(videoGag) \u2227 AirWeekly(videoGag)\nAirOn(videoGag, frenchBroadcastChannelTF1)\n\u2200x (Funny(x) \u2227 Video(x) \u2227 SendIn(viewers, x, frenchBroadcastChannelTF1)  \u2192 AirWeekly(x) ) \u2227 AirOn(videoGag, x))\n\u2200x (Video(x) \u2227 AirOn(videoGag, x) \u2192 In(x, french))", "conclusion": "Viewers send funny videos to the French broadcast channel TF1 that are in French.", "conclusion-FOL": "\u2203x (SendIn(viewers, x, frenchBroadcastChannelTF1) \u2227 French(x))", "label": "Uncertain", "example_id": 419, "question": "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nHere are premises:\nVideo Gag is a French television series that airs weekly.\nVideo Gag airs on the French broadcast channel TF1. \nIf viewers send funny videos to the French broadcast channel TF1, then Video Gag airs them weekly.\nAll videos aired on Video Gag are in French.\nBased on these premises, verify whether the conclusion 'Viewers send funny videos to the French broadcast channel TF1 that are in French.' is True, False, or Uncertain.", "rationale": "First, let\u2019s write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1.

(by #6) Step 3: Analyze John's status.\n- John is either both an iguana and a bird, or he is neither.\n#11. (by #8 #9) Step 4: Verify the possibility of John being both an iguana and a bird.\n- If John is an iguana, then he is a reptile.\n- If John is a bird, then he has wings and cannot be a reptile.\n- Therefore, John cannot be both an iguana and a bird because a bird cannot be a reptile.\n#12. (by #7) Step 5: Verify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states, \"John is not both an iguana and an animal that can fly.\"\n- Since John cannot be both an iguana and a bird (as established in Step 11), and birds are the animals that can fly (by #3), John cannot be both an iguana and an animal that can fly.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"John is not both an iguana and an animal that can fly\" is True.", "ctxs": [310], "ctxs_candidates": [[310], [312], [134], [645], [646], [133], [644], [392], [132], [394], [95], [393], [352], [97], [175], [350], [174], [351], [96], [638], [706], [176], [412], [480], [362], [705], [903], [640], [994], [668], [360], [361], [173], [177], [901], [586], [7], [172], [411], [666], [589], [399], [476], [227], [9], [588], [8], [854], [403]]}, {"story_id": 444, "premises": "All birds have wings.\nAnimals with wings aren't reptiles.\nSome animals that fly are birds.\nIf something is an iguana, then it is a reptile.

(by #2 #4) Step 2: Analyze the scarcity and usability of elements.\n- Non-rare earth elements are not scarce in China.\n- All rare earth elements can be used for industry.\n#9. (by #5 #6) Step 3: Analyze Lithium's essentiality for electronics.\n- If Lithium is a non-rare earth element, it must be essential for exploring future directions of electronics.\n- If Lithium is not essential for exploring future directions of electronics, it must not be a non-rare earth element.\n#10. (by #1 #7) Step 4: Analyze the atomic number condition.\n- There are no elements with atomic number between 61-63 that are not scarce in China.\n- Since all elements are either non-rare earth elements or rare earth elements, elements with atomic numbers between 61-63 must be rare earth elements.\n#11. (by #4 #5) Step 5: Analyze the usability and essentiality of rare earth elements.\n- All rare earth elements can be used for industry.\n- All rare earth elements are essential for exploring future directions of electronics.\n#12. (by #6 #9) Step 6: Verify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states, \"If Lithium is not essential for exploring future directions of electronics or an element with atomic number between 61-63, then Lithium is not a non-rare earth element or usable in industry.\"\n- If Lithium is not essential for exploring future directions of electronics, it must not be a non-rare earth element (by #9).\n- If Lithium is an element with atomic number between 61-63, it must be a rare earth element (by #10).\n- If Lithium is a rare earth element, it can be used for industry (by #4).\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If Lithium is not essential for exploring future directions of electronics or an element with atomic number between 61-63, then Lithium is not a non-rare earth element or usable in industry\" is True.", "ctxs": [630], "ctxs_candidates": [[630], [629], [627], [188], [187], [628], [626], [189], [638], [640], [625], [712], [713], [623], [711], [639], [918], [214], [749], [215], [37], [36], [213], [152], [916], [914], [216], [482], [913], [483], [972], [907], [912], [586], [758], [911], [589], [38], [174], [217], [917], [746], [747], [915], [41], [970], [495], [50], [905]]}, {"story_id": 332, "premises": "If people don't often clean their homes, then they do not have tidy houses.\nIf people don't prioritize cleaning, then they do not often clean their homes.\nIf people hire a maid or cleaning service, then they have tidy houses.\nIf people don't care about cleanliness, then they do not prioritize cleaning.\nEither Jack does hire a maid or cleaning service and does not often clean his home, or he does not hire a maid or cleaning service nor often clean his home.", "premises-FOL": "\u2200x (\u00acCleanOften(x, home) \u2192 \u00acHave(x, tidyHouse))\n\u2200x (\u00acPrioritize(x, cleaning) \u2192 \u00acCleanOften(x, home))\n\u2200x (Hire(x, maid) \u2228 Hire(x, cleaningService) \u2192 Have(x, tidyHouse))\n\u2200x (\u00acCareAbout(x, cleanliness) \u2192 \u00acPrioritize(x, cleaning))\n\u00ac(Hire(x, maid) \u2228 Hire(x, cleaningService)) \u2295 \u00acCleanOften(jack, home))", "conclusion": "Jack doesn't care about cleanliness.", "conclusion-FOL": "\u00ac(CareAbout(jack, cleanliness))", "label": "False", "example_id": 858, "question": "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nHere are premises:\nIf people don't often clean their homes, then they do not have tidy houses.\nIf people don't prioritize cleaning, then they do not often clean their homes.\nIf people hire a maid or cleaning service, then they have tidy houses.\nIf people don't care about cleanliness, then they do not prioritize cleaning.\nEither Jack does hire a maid or cleaning service and does not often clean his home, or he does not hire a maid or cleaning service nor often clean his home.\nBased on these premises, verify whether the conclusion 'Jack doesn't care about cleanliness.' is True, False, or Uncertain.", "rationale": "First, let\u2019s write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1.

FMRI is a neuroimaging technique.\nNext, let\u2019s answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n#7. (by #1 #6) Step 1: Classify FMRI.\n- Since FMRI is a neuroimaging technique, it must be either an invasive neuroimaging technique or a noninvasive neuroimaging technique.\n#8. (by #2 #3) Step 2: Analyze noninvasive neuroimaging techniques.\n- All noninvasive neuroimaging techniques provide a spatial resolution of brains.\n- If a technique provides a spatial resolution of brains, then it is a measurement of brain activity.\n#9. (by #4) Step 3: Analyze measurements of brain activity.\n- All measurements of brain activity are used by neuroscience researchers.\n#10. (by #5) Step 4: Analyze FMRI's classification.\n- FMRI is either a measurement of brain activity or a noninvasive neuroimaging technique.\n#11. (by #7 #10) Step 5: Consider the case if FMRI is not an invasive neuroimaging technique.\n- If FMRI is not an invasive neuroimaging technique, it must be a noninvasive neuroimaging technique (by #1).\n#12. (by #8) Step 6: Analyze the implications of FMRI being a noninvasive neuroimaging technique.\n- If FMRI is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique, it provides a spatial resolution of brains.\n- If FMRI provides a spatial resolution of brains, it is a measurement of brain activity.\n- If FMRI is a measurement of brain activity, it is used by neuroscience researchers (by #4).\n#13. (by #11 #12) Step 7: Verify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states, \"If fMRI is not an invasive neuroimaging technique used by neuroscience researchers, then fMRI is neither a noninvasive neuroimaging technique nor provides a spatial resolution of brains.\"\n- If FMRI is not an invasive neuroimaging technique, it must be a noninvasive neuroimaging technique.\n- If FMRI is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique, it provides a spatial resolution of brains and is a measurement of brain activity used by neuroscience researchers.\n- Therefore, the conclusion that \"FMRI is neither a noninvasive neuroimaging technique nor provides a spatial resolution of brains\" contradicts the premises.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If fMRI is not an invasive neuroimaging technique used by neuroscience researchers, then fMRI is neither a noninvasive neuroimaging technique nor provides a spatial resolution of brains\" is False.", "ctxs": [970], "ctxs_candidates": [[970], [971], [969], [831], [498], [505], [827], [887], [496], [829], [828], [698], [826], [830], [699], [749], [631], [696], [907], [747], [503], [746], [748], [712], [37], [504], [339], [497], [873], [38], [226], [36], [713], [341], [629], [905], [600], [154], [174], [39], [697], [359], [212], [495], [176], [173], [89], [336], [340]]}, {"story_id": 437, "premises": "Researchers present their work at the conference or provide a tutorial session there.\nEveryone who presents their work at the conference will attend in person. \nEveryone providing a tutorial session at the conference will be invited to join the club. \nEveryone who attends the conference in person is provided with souvenirs. \nEveryone invited to join the club is provided with delicious meals. \nEveryone provided with delicious meals is happy to communicate with each other during the dinner. \nEveryone who is provided with delicious meals is invited to take a photo with the audience. \nIt is not true that James both attended the conference in person and was provided with souvenirs.", "premises-FOL": "\u2200x (PresentWorkAt(x, conference) \u2295 ProvideAt(x, tutorialSession, conference))\n\u2200x (PresentWorkAt(x, conference) \u2192 AttendInPerson(x, conference))\n\u2200x (ProvideSessionAt(x, tutorial, conference) \u2192 InvitedToJoin(x, club))\n\u2200x (AttendInPerson(x, conference) \u2192 ProvidedWith(x, souvenir))\n\u2200x (InvitedToJoin(x, club) \u2192 ProvidedWith(x, deliciousMeal))\n\u2200x (ProvidedWith(x, deliciousMeal) \u2227 ProvidedWith(y, deliciousMeal)  \u2192 \u2203y \u2203z (\u00ac(y=x) \u2227 \u00ac(z=x) \u2227 \u00ac(y=z) \u2227 HappyToCommunicateWithDuringTheDinner(x, y) \u2227 HappyToCommunicateWithDuringTheDinner(x, z)))\n\u2200x (ProvidedWith(x, deliciousMeal) \u2192 InvitedToTakePhotoWith(x, audience))\n\u00ac(AttendInPerson(james, conference) \u2227 ProvidedWith(x, souvenir))", "conclusion": "James is provided with souvenirs.", "conclusion-FOL": "ProvidedWith(james, souvenir)", "label": "Uncertain", "example_id": 1253, "question": "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nHere are premises:\nResearchers present their work at the conference or provide a tutorial session there.\nEveryone who presents their work at the conference will attend in person. \nEveryone providing a tutorial session at the conference will be invited to join the club. \nEveryone who attends the conference in person is provided with souvenirs. \nEveryone invited to join the club is provided with delicious meals. \nEveryone provided with delicious meals is happy to communicate with each other during the dinner. \nEveryone who is provided with delicious meals is invited to take a photo with the audience. \nIt is not true that James both attended the conference in person and was provided with souvenirs.\nBased on these premises, verify whether the conclusion 'James is provided with souvenirs.' is True, False, or Uncertain.", "rationale": "First, let\u2019s write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.\n#1.
