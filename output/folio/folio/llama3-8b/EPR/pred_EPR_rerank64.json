(by #2 #3) Step 1: Analyze the relationship between growing up in a health-conscious childhood home and fulfilling daily nutritional intakes. - All people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes eat salads regularly. - All people who fulfill their daily nutritional intakes grew up in health-conscious childhood homes. - Therefore, people who grew up in health-conscious childhood homes fulfill their daily nutritional intakes. #8. (by #1) Step 2: Analyze the relationship between eating salads regularly and being conscious about health and eating habits. - All people who eat salads regularly are very conscious about their health and eating habits. #9. (by #4) Step 3: Consider the characteristics of people who disregard their physical well-being. - All people who disregard their physical well-being are not very conscious about their health and eating habits. #10. (by #5) Step 4: Consider the relationship between visiting the gym and fulfilling daily nutritional intakes. - If people visit the gym at least once a day, then they always fulfill their daily nutritional intakes. #11. (by #6) Step 5: Consider Taylor's situation. - Taylor either grew up in a health-conscious childhood home and disregard her physical well-being, or she did neither. #12. (by #7 #8) Step 6: Analyze Taylor's situation. - If Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she fulfills her daily nutritional intakes (by #7). - If Taylor fulfills her daily nutritional intakes, then she visits the gym at least once a day (by #10). - Therefore, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she visits the gym at least once a day. #13. (by #9 #11) Step 7: Analyze Taylor's situation. - If Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day, then she does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes (by #10). - If Taylor does not fulfill her daily nutritional intakes, then she did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home (by #7). - Therefore, if Taylor does not visit the gym at least once a day, then she did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home. #14. (by #6) Step 8: Verify the conclusion. - The conclusion states that Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day. - Based on the analysis above, if Taylor grew up in a health-conscious childhood home, then she visits the gym at least once a day. - Therefore, Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home. - Since Taylor did not grow up in a health-conscious childhood home, she does not visit the gym at least once a day. Therefore, the conclusion \"Taylor neither grew up in a health-conscious childhood home nor does she visit the gym at least once a day\" is True.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant: I've gone through the problems and provided the answers.
