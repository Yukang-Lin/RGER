Since 15 people got off, the number of people in the bus increased by 15 - 15 = 0.\nTherefore, the number of people in the bus when Jose got on was 3 - 8 - 0 = -5.\nHowever, we know that the number of people in the bus when Jose got on was 30, so this answer is incorrect.\nWe need to re-examine the problem and look for any errors or missing information.\nUpon reviewing the problem, we notice that the number of people who got on at the terminal station is not given.
