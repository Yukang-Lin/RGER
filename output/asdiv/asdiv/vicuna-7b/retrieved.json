Since each diamond weighs 20 g, the total weight of 4 diamonds is 4 * 20 g = 80 g.\n\nNow, we know that the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 g. We can subtract the weight of the 4 diamonds from the total weight to find the weight of the 2 jades: 140 g - 80 g = 60 g.\n\nFinally, we need to find the weight of a single jade.

We can write this as an equation:\n\n(1/3)x + (1/5)x = (8/15)x\n\nTo solve for x, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for 3 and 5 is 15. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(5/15)x + (3/15)x = (8/15)x\n\nNow, we can combine the fractions on the left side:\n\n(5x + 3x)/15 = (8/15)x\n\n8x/15 = (8/15)x\n\nSince the left side and the right side of the equation are equal, we can conclude that the equation holds true for any value of x. However, the problem asks for a specific number, so we can assume that the number is 1 (since any number multiplied by 1 remains the same).\n\nSo, the number is 1. To check our calculation, we can substitute x = 1 into the original equation:\n\n(1/3)(1) + (1/5)(1) = (8/15)(1)\n\n1/3 + 1/5 = 8/15\n\nTo add the fractions on the left side, we need a common denominator, which is 15:\n\n(5/15) + (3/15) = 8/15\n\n8/15 = 8/15\n\nThe calculation is correct, and the number is 1.", "ctxs": [1173], "ctxs_candidates": [[1173], [1403], [808], [40], [1782], [1135], [1668], [811], [1427], [1459], [884], [584], [1266], [835], [727], [974], [1624], [1455], [169], [768], [1801], [987], [624], [1328], [1643], [1548], [286], [1533], [1272], [769], [969], [1339], [194], [1010], [813], [445], [1615], [469], [1438], [1775], [1433], [1489], [1755], [1372], [117], [1240], [1817], [1265], [1651]]}, {"ID": "nluds-0909", "Grade": 6, "Source": "http://www.mathplayground.com", "Body": "Ben had some baseball cards.

Since 5 single beds weigh 50 kg, we can divide the total weight by the number of beds to find the weight of one single bed: 50 kg / 5 = 10 kg.\n\nNext, let's find the total weight of the 2 single beds: 2 single beds * 10 kg = 20 kg.\n\nNow, we know that the total weight of 2 single beds and 4 double beds is 100 kg. So, we can subtract the weight of the 2 single beds from the total weight to find the weight of the 4 double beds: 100 kg - 20 kg = 80 kg.\n\nFinally, let's find the weight of one double bed by dividing the total weight of the 4 double beds by the number of double beds: 80 kg / 4 = 20 kg.\n\nNow, we can find the difference in weight between a double bed and a single bed: 20 kg (double bed) - 10 kg (single bed) = 10 kg.\n\nSo, a double bed is 10 kg heavier than a single bed.

If we use only large trucks, we can calculate the maximum number of large trucks that can be used without exceeding 134 tons:\n\n134 tons \u00f7 15 tons/truck \u2248 8.93\n\nSince we can't use a fraction of a truck, the maximum number of large trucks we can use is 8. Now, let's calculate how many tons 8 large trucks can carry:\n\n8 large trucks \u00d7 15 tons/truck = 120 tons\n\nThis leaves us with:\n\n134 tons - 120 tons = 14 tons\n\nNow, we need to find out how many small trucks are needed to carry the remaining 14 tons. Each small truck can carry 7 tons, so:\n\n14 tons \u00f7 7 tons/truck = 2 small trucks\n\nTherefore, to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied, Mr. Lee should use 8 large trucks and 2 small trucks.

The numbers are 32 (maroon), 24 (white), and 16 (orange).\n\nFirst, we find the prime factors of each number:\n- 32: 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 (or 2^5)\n- 24: 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 (or 2^3 \u00d7 3)\n- 16: 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 (or 2^4)\n\nThe GCD is found by taking the lowest power of all common prime factors. Here, the common prime factor is 2, and the lowest power among 2^5, 2^3, and 2^4 is 2^3.\n\nTherefore, the GCD is 2^3 = 8.\n\nSo, the greatest number of identical balloon arrangements Shannon can make is 8. Each arrangement will have 32 \u00f7 8 = 4 maroon balloons, 24 \u00f7 8 = 3 white balloons, and 16 \u00f7 8 = 2 orange balloons.The answer is 8.", "ctxs": [698], "ctxs_candidates": [[698], [1503], [14], [641], [1019], [746], [116], [1398], [458], [799], [606], [213], [1121], [1671], [15], [1482], [1251], [11], [957], [1040], [654], [271], [961], [1375], [61], [755], [1639], [1514], [1649], [80], [285], [1001], [560], [904], [232], [1831], [270], [31], [47], [1505], [1494], [1657], [534], [1497], [1839], [1454], [707], [582], [938]]}, {"ID": "nluds-0595", "Grade": 3, "Source": "http://www.k5learning.com", "Body": "Megan had 217 markers.

Since Flash was tied to a pole in the middle of the yard, the area he could reach is a circle with a radius of 10 ft.\n\nThe area of a circle is calculated using the formula:\nArea = \u03c0 * radius^2\n\nUsing \u03c0 \u2248 3.14, we get:\nArea = 3.14 * 10^2 = 3.14 * 100 = 314 square feet\n\nNext, we need to determine how many packages of grass seed Theo needs to cover this area. Each package covers 50 square feet, so:\nNumber of packages = Total area / Area covered by one package\nNumber of packages = 314 / 50 \u2248 6.28\n\nSince Theo cannot buy a fraction of a package, he needs to purchase 7 packages (rounding up to the nearest whole number).\n\nFinally, we calculate the total cost:\nTotal cost = Number of packages * Cost per package\nTotal cost = 7 * $1.40 = $9.80\n\nSo, it cost Theo $9.80 to reseed the lawn.
