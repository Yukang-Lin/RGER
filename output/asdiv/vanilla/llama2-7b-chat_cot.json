The president also wants to make sure that no one is left out. What is the greatest number of groups the president can make? ",
        "answer": "To determine the greatest number of groups the president can make, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 16 and 8.\nLet's find the GCD step by step:\n1. Prime Factorization of 16:\n   16 = 4^3\n2. Prime Factorization of 8:\n   8 = 2^3\nNext, we identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers:\n- The common prime factor among 16 and 8 is 4.\n- The lowest power of 4 in the factorizations is 3.\nThus, the GCD of 16 and 8 is 4^3 = 64.\nTherefore, the president can make 64 groups of girls and boys.\nThe answer is 64."

        "answer": "To find out how much more money Colton spent on lunch than on breakfast, you need to subtract the total cost of breakfast from the total cost of lunch.\nHere is the calculation:\nBreakfast cost= $1.80 + $1.40 = $3.20\nLunch cost= $2.75 + $6.70 + $1.70 = $10.55\nSubtracting the breakfast cost from the lunch cost gives you the difference:\n$10.55 - $3.20 = $7.35\nTherefore, Colton spent $7.35 more on lunch than on breakfast.\nThe answer is $7.35."

If Zayed creates the greatest number of identical packages possible, how many pencils will be in each package?",
        "answer": "To determine how many pencils will be in each package, we need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of packages Zayed wants to make.\nHere is the calculation:\nNumber of pencils per package=\u230872/number of packages\u2309=72/4=18\nSince 18 is not a whole number, you need to round up to the next whole number, which is 20.\nTherefore, each package will contain 20 pencils.\nThe answer is 20."

        "question": "The difference of 5 times a number and 17 is 23. Find the number and 5 times the number.",
        "answer": "To solve this problem, we can use the information given in the question:\nLet the number be x.\nThen, 5 times the number is 5x.\nThe difference between 5x and 17 is 23, so we can set up the equation:\n5x - 17 = 23\nTo solve for x, we can add 17 to both sides of the equation:\n5x = 23 + 17\n5x = 40\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5 to find the value of x:\nx = 40/5\nx = 8\nSo, the number is 8, and 5 times the number is 40.\nThe answer is 8 and 40."

Prime Factorization of 54:\n   54 = 2^2 * 3^2\n2. Prime Factorization of 27:\n   27 = 3^3\nNext, we identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers:\n- The common prime factor among 54 and 27 is 3.\n- The lowest power of 3 in the factorizations is 3^2.\nThus, the GCD of 54 and 27 is 3^2 = 9.\nTherefore, the greatest number of trees Abe can have in each row is 9.\nThe answer is 9."

        "question": "Oscar needs to ship 14 rock CDs, 12 classical CDs, and 8 pop CDs. He can pack only one type of CD in each box and he must pack the same number of CDs in each box. What is the greatest number of CDs Oscar can pack in each box?",
        "answer": "To determine the greatest number of CDs Oscar can pack in each box, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers of CDs he needs to ship.\nLet's find the GCD step by step:\n1. Prime Factorization of 14:\n   14 = 2^2 * 7\n2. Prime Factorization of 12:\n   12 = 2^2\n3. Prime Factorization of 8:\n   8 = 2^1\nNext, we identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers:\n- The common prime factor among 14, 12, and 8 is 2.\n- The lowest power of 2 in the factorizations is 2^2.\nThus, the GCD of 14, 12, and 8 is 2^2 = 4.\nTherefore, the greatest number of CDs Oscar can pack in each box is 4.\nThe answer is 4."

        "question": "The perimeter of a rectangle is 150 cm. The length is 15 cm greater than the width. Find the dimensions.",
        "answer": "To find the dimensions of the rectangle, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P=2(l+w), where l is the length and w is the width.\nGiven that the perimeter is 150 cm, we can set up the equation:\n2(l+w)=150\nNow, we are given that the length is 15 cm greater than the width, so we can write:\nl=w+15\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n2(w+15+w)=150\nSimplifying, we get:\n4w+30=150\nSubtracting 30 from both sides, we get:\n4w=120\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\nw=30\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length:\nl=w+15=30+15=45\nTherefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are 45 cm long and 30 cm wide.\nThe answer is 45 cm long and 30 cm wide."
