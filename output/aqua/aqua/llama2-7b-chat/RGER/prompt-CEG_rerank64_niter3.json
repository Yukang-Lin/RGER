We get, x = h/\u221a3 = 10 (1 + \u221a3) / 2 = 5* (1 + \u221a3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + \u221a3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A", "correct": "A", "ctxs": [636, 768, 903, 347, 73, 495, 604, 825], "ctxs_candidates": [[539], [304], [846], [889], [287], [261], [911], [191], [227], [636], [659], [548], [157], [73], [105], [133], [51], [645], [169], [996], [262], [956], [196], [942], [667], [186], [881], [11], [632], [175], [63], [481], [495], [306], [997], [162], [602], [999], [773], [953], [313], [768], [347], [265], [328], [903], [774], [604], [640], [845]]}, {"question": "The original price of an item is discounted 22%.
