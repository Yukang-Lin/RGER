Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/\u221a3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h \u2013 x = h - h/\u221a3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 \u2013 1\u221a3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 \u2013 1\u221a3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/\u221a3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3)\nh / \u221a3 = 10/ \u221a3 * (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3).

We get, x = h/\u221a3 = 10 (1 + \u221a3) / 2 = 5* (1 + \u221a3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + \u221a3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A", "correct": "A", "ctxs": [659, 632, 889, 261, 886, 157, 602, 105], "ctxs_candidates": [[659], [632], [889], [261], [886], [157], [602], [105], [495], [347], [520], [287], [890], [332], [346], [209], [999], [11], [288], [604], [544], [265], [496], [196], [255], [306], [773], [645], [934], [838], [539], [304], [617], [240], [420], [60], [527], [252], [402], [180], [938], [956], [566], [47], [169], [835], [313], [262], [552], [204]]}, {"question": "The original price of an item is discounted 22%.
