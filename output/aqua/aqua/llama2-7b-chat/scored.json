However, this problem has variable in its answer choice, and relatively simple math. Therefore, an easy alternative is picking numbers.\nSince we're dealing with exponents, we want to keep things as easy as possible. Hence, we'll start with the easiest exponent possible: n = 1. A, B, and C are not solved (x^-n = 1/(x^n), so we're comparing integers to fractions), but choices D and E both end up valid, eliminating them from contention.\nIn the process of doing this, however, we've uncovered a major clue to our next step: A, B, and C, all compared integers to fractions, and the only integer equal to it's reciprocal is 1, which is equal to 1/1.
