Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/\u221a3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h \u2013 x = h - h/\u221a3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 \u2013 1\u221a3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 \u2013 1\u221a3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/\u221a3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3)\nh / \u221a3 = 10/ \u221a3 * (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3).

We get, x = h/\u221a3 = 10 (1 + \u221a3) / 2 = 5* (1 + \u221a3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + \u221a3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A", "correct": "A", "ctxs": [105, 999, 252, 685, 261, 886, 520, 346], "ctxs_candidates": [[105], [999], [252], [685], [261], [886], [520], [346], [889], [380], [288], [204], [789], [815], [66], [632], [539], [511], [262], [887], [11], [347], [180], [604], [881], [846], [184], [602], [209], [527], [890], [186], [437], [438], [569], [263], [640], [230], [240], [541], [443], [279], [667], [822], [265], [40], [137], [47], [271], [934]]}, {"question": "The original price of an item is discounted 22%.
