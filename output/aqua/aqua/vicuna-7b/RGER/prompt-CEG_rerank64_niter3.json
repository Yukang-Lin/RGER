Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/\u221a3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h \u2013 x = h - h/\u221a3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 \u2013 1\u221a3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 \u2013 1\u221a3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/\u221a3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3)\nh / \u221a3 = 10/ \u221a3 * (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3).

We get, x = h/\u221a3 = 10 (1 + \u221a3) / 2 = 5* (1 + \u221a3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + \u221a3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A", "correct": "A", "ctxs": [402, 11, 539, 789, 604, 279, 288, 209], "ctxs_candidates": [[105], [539], [999], [262], [886], [685], [346], [73], [186], [288], [252], [520], [380], [632], [261], [903], [889], [180], [204], [347], [887], [66], [569], [645], [815], [437], [604], [789], [133], [659], [40], [137], [703], [938], [263], [443], [87], [548], [527], [890], [358], [586], [402], [279], [846], [424], [511], [602], [420], [881]]}, {"question": "The original price of an item is discounted 22%.
