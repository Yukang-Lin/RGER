We need r to be maximum so k and m should be as small as possible to get the average of 10. Since all the numbers are positive integers, k and m cannot be less than 1 and 2 respectively. 1 is 9 less than 10 and 2 is 8 less than 10 which means k and m combined are 17 less than the average. 20 is already 10 more than 10 and hence we only have 17 - 10 = 7 extra to distribute between r and s.

To help see this, consider the following examples:\n4/10 is 0 with a remainder of 4\n14/10 is 1 with a remainder of 4\n5/10 is 0 with a remainder of 5\n105/10 is 10 with a remainder of 5\nIt is also essential to remember that the q is a positive integer and multiple of 2. Any integer that is a multiple of 2 is an even number. So, q must be a positive even integer.\nWith these two observations, the question can be simplified to:what is the units digit of 4 raised to an even positive integer?\nThe units digit of 4 raised to an integer follows a specific repeating pattern:\n4^1 = 4\n4^2 = 16\n4^3 = 64\n4^4 = 256\n4^(odd number) --> units digit of 4\n4^(even number) --> units digit of 6\nThere is a clear pattern regarding the units digit. 4 raised to any odd integer has a units digit of 4 while 4 raised to any even integer has a units digit of 6.\nSince q must be an even integer, the units digit of p=4^q will always be 6. Consequently, the remainder when p=4^q is divided by 10 will always be 6.\nIn case this is too theoretical, consider the following examples:\nq=2 --> p=4^q=16 --> p/10 = 1 with a remainder of 6\nq=4 --> p=4^q=256 --> p/10 = 25 with a remainder of 6\nq=6 --> p=4^q=4096 --> p/10 = 409 with a remainder of 6\nq=8 --> p=4^q=65536 --> p/10 = 6553 with a remainder of 6\nAnswer: B."], "ctxs_candidates": [[952], [266], [723], [420], [848], [526], [790], [56], [593], [12], [798], [150], [870], [726], [432], [725], [132], [366], [851], [496], [240], [31], [628], [917], [293], [992], [701], [616], [605], [60], [887], [155], [780], [892], [523], [717], [245], [78], [835], [529], [42], [431], [755], [601], [305], [561], [124], [574], [993]], "ctxs": [952]}, {"question": "Find the value of (1-(1/3))(1-(1/4))(1-(1/5))\u2026.(1-(1/100)).", "correct": "A", "rationale": "Answer is A.", "options": ["A)1/50", "B)3/50", "C)4/50", "D)6/50", "E)9/50"], "idx": 830, "prompt": "In one alloy there is 10% chromium while in another alloy it is 6%. 15 kg of the first alloy was melted together with 35 kg of the second one to form a third alloy.

The area of a square region with side AB --> side=AB=(10-5) or 5 --> the area of a square is 5^2=25, so only one possible value;\nII. The circumference of a circle passing through points A and B --> circle is not defined by only two points, hence the circumference of a circle passing through points A and B can take infinitely many values. For example consider when AB=diameter and when points A and B are not the endpoints of the diameter;\nIII. The area of a rectangular region with diagonal AB --> consider the case when AB is the diagonal of a square (the area is 25/2) and the case when AB is the diagonal of a rectangle with the sides equal to 3 and 4 (the area 12).\nAnswer: A."], "ctxs_candidates": [[919], [55], [545], [185], [569], [360], [579], [668], [287], [780], [618], [63], [860], [819], [90], [824], [255], [252], [870], [114],
