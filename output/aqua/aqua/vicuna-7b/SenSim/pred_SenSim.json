The letters A, B, and C are used only by government vehicles while the letters D through Z are used by non-government vehicles. Kerrania's intelligence agency has recently captured a message from the country Gonzalia indicating that an electronic transmitter has been installed in a Kerrania government vehicle with a license plate starting with 79. If it takes the police 9 minutes to inspect each vehicle, what is the probability that the police will find the transmitter within three hours?\nAnswer Choices: A)18/79 B)1/6 C)1/45 D)1/50 E)1/900\nA: Let's think step by step\nIf it takes 9 minutes to inspect one vehicle, the # of vehicles that can be inspected in 3 hours (180 minutes) = 180/9 = 20. Hence, for calculating the probability that the police will find the transmitter within three hours, the favorable cases = 20. Now, we need to figure out the total # of cases.\nThe total # of cases = Total # of such cars possible. The details given about the car is that it starts with 79, which leaves 2 more digits, both of which can be filled by all 10 numbers (0-9). In addition, we have 3 letters, each of which can be filled by any from the set {A,B,C}. Hence the total # of such cars possible = 10*10*3*3 = 900\nSo, the probability that the police will find the transmitter within three hours = 20/900 = 1/45.
