        "answer": "The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day. So the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day*14 feet long rope=140 sq.ft. per day. So the cow grazes 140 sq.ft. per day*14 feet long rope=1960 sq.ft. per day. So the cow grazes 1960 sq.ft. per day*10 sq.ft. per day=19600 sq.ft. per day. So the cow grazes 19600 sq.ft. per day*14 feet long rope=284800 sq.ft. per day. So the cow grazes 284800 sq.ft. per day*10 sq.ft. per day=2848000 sq.ft. per day. So the cow grazes 2848000 sq.ft. per day*14 feet long rope=3965600 sq.ft. per day. So the cow grazes 3965600 sq.ft. per day*10 sq.ft. per day=39656000 sq.ft. per day.

        "answer": "Let the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy X be x:y and in alloy Y be x':y'. Then, 6x:9y=69:91 and 7x':11y'=59:91. So, 6x+7x'=69 and 9y+11y'=91. Solving for x and x', we get x=6 and x'=5. So, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 6:9. The answer is (a)."

By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.",
        "answer": "Let the distance between X and Y be x. Then, Allen travels 54km in 1hr. So, he travels 54/54kmph=1km in 1hr. Bob travels 78km in 1hr. So, he travels 78/78kmph=1km in 1hr. So, Allen travels 1km in 1hr and Bob travels 1km in 1hr. So, Allen travels 1km in 1hr and Bob travels 1km in 1hr. So, Allen travels 1km in 1hr and Bob travels 1km in 1hr.
