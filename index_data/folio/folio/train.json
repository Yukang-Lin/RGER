(by #5) Step 3: Analyze James's status.\n- James is either good at chemistry and failed the class, or bad at chemistry and passed the class.\n- If James is good at chemistry, he must be good at planning (from #6).\n- If James is good at planning, he cannot have failed the class (from #7), which contradicts the first part of the statement that he is good at chemistry and failed the class.\n- Therefore, James cannot be good at chemistry and failed the class simultaneously.\n- Hence, James must be bad at chemistry and passed the class.\n#9. (by #8) Step 4: Verify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states, \"If James is good at Chemistry or failed the class, then James is either good at planning or good at math.\"\n- From #8, we know James is bad at chemistry and passed the class.\n- Therefore, James is not good at chemistry and did not fail the class.\n- Since James is bad at chemistry, the condition \"James is good at Chemistry\" is false.\n- Since James passed the class, the condition \"James failed the class\" is false.\n- Therefore, the antecedent \"James is good at Chemistry or failed the class\" is false.\n- In logic, if the antecedent of an implication is false, the implication is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If James is good at Chemistry or failed the class, then James is either good at planning or good at math\" is True.",

(by #3) Step 2: Analyze the relationship between enjoying gelato, loving to travel, and vacationing often.\n- Hodophiles enjoy eating gelato ice cream or love to travel and vacation often, or both.\n#9. (by #5) Step 3: Analyze the relationship between loving to travel, vacationing often, and studying abroad in Europe.\n- If hodophiles love to travel and vacation often, then they study abroad in Europe.\n#10. (by #6) Step 4: Analyze Robert's preferences.\nRobert is a hodophile with two possibilities:\n- He enjoys eating gelato ice cream and loves to travel and vacation often.\n- He does not enjoy eating gelato ice cream and does not love to travel and vacation often.\n#11. (by #7 #8) Step 5: Analyze the relationship between enjoying a vacation to Italy and enjoying gelato ice cream.\n- All hodophiles who enjoy eating gelato ice cream would enjoy a vacation to Italy.\n- Therefore, if Robert enjoys eating gelato ice cream, he would enjoy a vacation to Italy.\n#12. (by #4) Step 6: Analyze the relationship between studying abroad and regretting college experiences.\n- No hodophiles who study abroad in Europe regret their college experiences.\n#13. (by #9 #12) Step 7: Analyze the relationship between loving to travel, regretting college experiences, and studying abroad in Europe.\n- If hodophiles love to travel and vacation often, then they study abroad in Europe.\n- Therefore, hodophiles who study abroad in Europe love to travel and vacation often, and do not regret their college experiences.\n#14. (by #10) Step 8: Analyze Robert's status as a hodophile who either enjoys gelato and loves to travel or does not enjoy gelato and does not love to travel.\n- If Robert enjoys gelato and loves to travel, he is a hodophile who loves to travel and vacation often.\n- If Robert does not enjoy gelato and does not love to travel, he is a hodophile who does not love to travel and vacation often.\n#15. (by #9 #14) Step 9: Analyze Robert's status as a hodophile who studies abroad in Europe.\n- If Robert is a hodophile who loves to travel and vacation often, he would study abroad in Europe.\n- If Robert is a hodophile who does not love to travel and vacation often, he would not study abroad in Europe.\n#16. (by #11 #15) Step 10: Combine Robert's preferences and status as a hodophile.\n- If Robert enjoys gelato and loves to travel, he would enjoy a vacation to Italy and study abroad in Europe.\n- If Robert does not enjoy gelato and does not love to travel, he would not enjoy a vacation to Italy and would not study abroad in Europe.\n#17. (by #16) Step 11: Verify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states, \"If Robert either would both enjoy a vacation to Italy and regrets his college experiences or neither would enjoy a vacation to Italy nor regrets his college experiences, then Robert would either enjoy a vacation to Italy or he can resist the hallmark delectable desserts that are famous in Italy.\"\n- Since Robert falls into two possibilities based on Step 10:\n  - If Robert enjoys gelato and loves to travel, he would enjoy a vacation to Italy and does not regret his college experiences.\n  - If Robert does not enjoy gelato and does not love to travel, he would not enjoy a vacation to Italy and does not regret his college experiences.\n- In both cases, the conclusion is true.\nTherefore, the conclusion is True.",

(by #1 #2) Step 1: Analyze the relationship between fish and birds.\n- No fish are birds.\n- An osprey is a bird, so an osprey cannot be a fish.\n#7. (by #3 #4) Step 2: Analyze the relationship between carp and goldfish.\n- A carp is a fish.\n- All goldfish are carp, so all goldfish are fish.\n#8. (by #5) Step 3: Analyze the condition given for Bubbles.\n- If Bubbles is either an osprey or a goldfish, then Bubbles is not also a fish.\n#9. (by #7 #8) Step 4: Verify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states, \"Bubbles is not a goldfish.\"\n- If Bubbles were a goldfish, then Bubbles would be a carp, and therefore a fish.\n- However, the premise states that if Bubbles is a goldfish, then Bubbles is not also a fish, which is a contradiction because all goldfish are fish.\n- Therefore, Bubbles cannot be a goldfish.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Bubbles is not a goldfish\" is True.",
        "question": "The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.\nThe problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nHere are premises:\nNo fish are birds.\nAn osprey is a bird.\nA carp is a fish.\nAll goldfish are carp.\nIf Bubbles is either an osprey or a goldfish, then Bubbles is not also a fish.\nBased on these premises, verify whether the conclusion 'Bubbles is not a goldfish.' is True, False, or Uncertain."

(by #4) Step 4: Analyze the relationship between owning appliances and ordering takeout.\n- If people in this neighborhood own at least one coffeemaker and one blender in their home, then they do not order takeout at least once a day.\n#11. (by #8 #10) Step 5: Combine the scenarios for Sam.\n- If Sam leads a very busy life, he orders takeout at least once a day (from #8).\n- If Sam does not lead a very busy life, we do not have enough information to determine his takeout habits directly, but we know he is not addicted to coffee.\n#12. (by #6) Step 6: Verify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states, \"Sam is living in this neighborhood and he owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender in his home or orders takeout at least once a day.\"\n- If Sam leads a very busy life, he orders takeout at least once a day (from #8).\n- If Sam does not lead a very busy life, we do not have enough information to determine if he owns a coffeemaker and blender, but we know he does not order takeout at least once a day (from #10).\nTherefore, regardless of whether Sam leads a very busy life or not, the conclusion \"Sam is living in this neighborhood and he owns at least one coffeemaker and one blender in his home or orders takeout at least once a day\" is always true.\nTherefore, the conclusion is True.",

(by #4 #7) Step 2: Analyze the implications of James's age.\n- Since James is older than 80, he cannot be rewarded with a $30 gift card.\n- Therefore, James cannot choose a Prime Video Plan because all customers who choose a Prime Video Plan are rewarded with a $30 gift card.\n#9. (by #1 #3) Step 3: Determine James's plan choice.\n- Customers must choose a Prime Video plan, an HBO Max Plan, or both.\n- There are no customers who do not choose any plan.\n- Since James cannot choose a Prime Video Plan, he must choose an HBO Max Plan.\n#10. (by #9) Step 4: Verify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states, \"James is a customer who chooses a Prime Video plan or does not choose any plans.\"\n- Based on the premises, James cannot choose a Prime Video plan.\n- Also, there are no customers who do not choose any plan.\n- Therefore, the conclusion \"James is a customer who chooses a Prime Video plan or does not choose any plans\" is False.\nTherefore, the conclusion is False.",

(by #4) Step 2: Analyze the mutation status of adenocarcinoma.\n- No type of cancer is without mutations.\n- Therefore, if adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer, it must have mutations.\n#9. (by #6) Step 3: Apply the conditional statement about adenocarcinoma.\n- If adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer or without mutations or both, then adenocarcinoma is in women or without mutations or both.\n- Since adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer (from Step 7), the condition is satisfied.\n#10. (by #6) Step 4: Analyze the conclusion.\n- The conclusion states, \"Adenocarcinoma is a disease in women.\"\n- From the conditional statement, if adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer, it must be in women or without mutations or both.\n- Since adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer and all cancers have mutations (from Step 8), the only remaining condition is that adenocarcinoma is in women.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Adenocarcinoma is a disease in women\" is True.",

Hamlet has either sold more than one thousand copies or it is written by Neil Gaiman.\nNext, let’s answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n#6. (by #1 #5) Step 1: Analyze the sales and authorship of Hamlet.\n- If Hamlet is written by Neil Gaiman, then it has sold more than one thousand copies.\n- If Hamlet has sold more than one thousand copies, it satisfies the condition in #5.\n#7. (by #2) Step 2: Analyze the relationship between Hugo Awards and Neil Gaiman.\n- Some books that have won Hugo Awards are written by Neil Gaiman, but this does not necessarily apply to all books that have won Hugo Awards.\n#8. (by #3) Step 3: Analyze Tomas's reading habits.\n- Tomas has read all books written by Tolkien, but this does not provide direct information about Hamlet unless Hamlet is written by Tolkien.\n#9. (by #4) Step 4: Analyze the conditions for Hamlet.\n- Either Tomas has read Hamlet, or it has sold more than one thousand copies.\n- If Tomas has read Hamlet, it could be written by Tolkien.\n- If Hamlet has sold more than one thousand copies, it could be written by Neil Gaiman or another author.\n#10. (by #5) Step 5: Verify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states, \"If Hamlet has either won a Hugo Award and is written by Tolkien, or neither has won a Hugo Award nor is written by Tolkien, then Hamlet has neither won a Hugo Award nor is written by Neil Gaiman.\"\n- Consider the first part: \"If Hamlet has either won a Hugo Award and is written by Tolkien.\"\n  - If Hamlet is written by Tolkien, it does not affect the sales condition directly.\n  - If Hamlet has won a Hugo Award, it could still be written by Neil Gaiman or another author.\n- Consider the second part: \"or neither has won a Hugo Award nor is written by Tolkien.\"\n  - If Hamlet has neither won a Hugo Award nor is written by Tolkien, it could still be written by Neil Gaiman or another author.\n- The conclusion \"then Hamlet has neither won a Hugo Award nor is written by Neil Gaiman\" does not necessarily follow from the premises provided.\n  - The premises do not provide enough information to definitively conclude that Hamlet has neither won a Hugo Award nor is written by Neil Gaiman based on the given conditions.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If Hamlet has either won a Hugo Award and is written by Tolkien, or neither has won a Hugo Award nor is written by Tolkien, then Hamlet has neither won a Hugo Award nor is written by Neil Gaiman\" is Uncertain.",

(by #1 #2) Step 1: Analyze the relationship between innocence, guilt, and crime.\n- Any convicted criminal that is innocent is not truly guilty.\n- All convicted criminals who did not commit a crime are truly innocent.\n- Therefore, if a convicted criminal did not commit a crime, they are truly innocent and not truly guilty.\n#8. (by #3) Step 2: Analyze the status of convicted criminals.\n- All convicted criminals are truly guilty or found guilty.\n- Therefore, if a convicted criminal is not found guilty, they must be truly guilty.\n#9. (by #4 #5) Step 3: Analyze the implications of being found guilty.\n- If a convicted criminal is found guilty, then they are sentenced to a punishment.\n- If a convicted criminal is found guilty, then they can argue against their punishment.\n#10. (by #6) Step 4: Analyze Garry's status.\n- Garry is a convicted criminal who is not found guilty or is sentenced to punishment.\n- This means Garry is either not found guilty or is sentenced to punishment.\n#11. (by #8 #10) Step 5: Combine Garry's possible scenarios.\n- If Garry is not found guilty, then by #8, he must be truly guilty.\n- If Garry is sentenced to punishment, it implies he was found guilty (by #4).\n#12. (by #7 #11) Step 6: Verify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states, \"Garry is not both innocent and someone who did not commit a crime.\"\n- If Garry is truly guilty (by #8), he cannot be innocent (by #7).\n- If Garry did not commit a crime, he would be truly innocent (by #2), which contradicts the fact that he is truly guilty.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Garry is not both innocent and someone who did not commit a crime\" is True.",
