Each integer is a real number.\n#4. Natural numbers are integers.\n#5. Every prime number is a natural number.\n#6. Every natural number is not negative.\n#7. Mersenne primes are prime.\n#8. Every prime number is prime.\n#9. Each real number is not imaginary.\n#10. Complex numbers are imaginary.\n#11. 3 is a Mersenne prime.\nNext, let’s answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:\n#12. (by #11 #1)3 is a Mersenne prime.Mersenne primes are prime numbers.3 is a prime number.\n#13. (by #12 #5)3 is a prime number.Every prime number is a natural number.3 is a natural number.\n#14. (by #13 #4)3 is a natural number.Natural numbers are integers.3 is an integer.\n#15. (by #14 #3)3 is an integer.Each integer is a real number.3 is a real number.\n#16. (by #15 #9)3 is a real number.Each real number is not imaginary.3 is not imaginary.\nTherefore, the conclusion \"3 is imaginary.\" is False."
