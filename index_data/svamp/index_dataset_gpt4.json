She collected 49 more dollars from the ATM.\nTotal money after visiting the ATM = 3 + 49 = 52 dollars.\n\nStep 2: Determine how much she spent at the supermarket.\nAfter visiting the supermarket, Olivia had 49 dollars left.\nSo, the amount she spent at the supermarket = Total money after ATM - Money left after visiting the supermarket\n= 52 - 49 = 3 dollars.\n\nStep 3: Determine how much more money she collected from the ATM than she spent at the supermarket.\nAmount collected from ATM = 49 dollars\nAmount spent at the supermarket = 3 dollars\nDifference = 49 - 3 = 46 dollars.\n\nTherefore, Olivia collected 46 dollars more from the ATM than she spent at the supermarket.\nThe answer is 46."

This situation is inconsistent because only 5 children were initially riding. This suggests a missing or inconsistent piece of information.\n\nLet's assume a more plausible scenario:\n- Assume there are additional children boarded initially to account for the large number getting off.\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, let's find the number of children that boarded afterward to result in 14 children being on the bus after adjustments:\n\n4. **Final Number of Children on the Bus:**\n   - After all the adjustments (5 initially, 63 got off, and some additional got on), there are 14 children on the bus.\n\nNow, solving for how many got on:\n\n   Number who initially got on minus those who get off + new children = 14\n   \\( x - 63 + y = 14\\)\n\nWe already know from the initial 5 children:\n   \\( 5 - 63 + y = 14 \\)\n   \\(  -58 + y = 14 \\)\n   \\( y = 14 + 58 \\)\n   \\( y = 72 \\)\n\nTherefore, it seems 72 additional children got on the bus.\n   \n5. **Calculating the Number Who Got on Compared to Who Got off:**\n   - Number of children got on (72) minus got off (63):\n   \\( 72 - 63 = 9\\)\n\n   Therefore, **9 more children got on the bus than those that got off**.\nThe answer is 9."
