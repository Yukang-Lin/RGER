Q: I want to plant 45 sunflower plants, 81 corn plants and 63 tomato plants in my garden. If I put the same number of plants in each row and each row has only one type of plant,what is the greatest number of plants I can put in one row?
A: To determine the greatest number of plants I can put in one row while ensuring each row has the same number of plants and only one type of plant, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers 45, 81, and 63.
Let's find the GCD step by step:
1.Prime Factorization of 45:
   45 = 3^2 *5
2. Prime Factorization of 81:
   81 = 3^4
3. Prime Factorization of 63:
   63 = 3^2 * 7
Next, we identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers:
- The common prime factor among 45, 81, and 63 is 3.
- The lowest power of 3 in the factorizations is 3^2.
Thus, the GCD of 45, 81, and 63 is 3^2 = 9.
Therefore, the greatest number of plants I can put in one row is 9.
The answer is 9.

Q: Mrs. Walker will have 56 apples for bobbing for apples. Each bucket will hold 9 apples.How many buckets will she need?
A: To determine how many buckets Mrs. Walker will need, you can divide the total number of apples by the number of apples each bucket can hold and round up to the next whole number since a partial bucket will still require a whole bucket.
Here is the calculation:
Number of buckets=⌈56/9⌉=6.22
Since 6.22 is not a whole number, you need to round up to the next whole number, which is 7.
Therefore, Mrs. Walker will need 7 buckets to hold all 56 apples.
The answer is 7.

Q: Denise has 210 crayons and 3 blocks. If she shares the crayons among 30 friends,how many crayons does each friend get?
A: To find out how many crayons each friend gets, you divide the total number of crayons by the number of friends.
Here is the calculation:
30/210=7
So, each friend will get 7 crayons.
The answer is 7.

Q: Two of the lights at the local stadium are flickering. They both just flickered at the same time. One of the lights flickers every 7 seconds and the other light flickers every 8 seconds.How many seconds until both lights will flicker at the same time again?
A: To find out when both lights will flicker at the same time again, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the two intervals: 7 seconds and 8 seconds.
Since 7 and 8 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product:
LCM(7,8)=7×8=56
Therefore, both lights will flicker at the same time again in 56 seconds.
The answer is 56.
