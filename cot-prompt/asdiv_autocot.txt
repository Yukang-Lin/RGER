Bianca had 45 coloring books originally. She gave away 6, so she had 45 - 6 = 39 coloring books left. Then she bought 20 more, so she now has 39 + 20 = 59 coloring books in total. The answer is 59.

Q: Vanessa received six hundred twenty-two dollars for her birthday. Later she found some toys that cost nine dollars each. How much money would she have left if she bought as many as she could?
A:Let's think step by step
Vanessa has $622 initially. Each toy costs $9. To find out how many toys she can buy, we divide her total money by the cost of each toy: 622 ÷ 9 = 69 toys (with a remainder of 1 dollar). Since she can buy 69 toys, we multiply the number of toys by the cost of each toy: 69 × 9 = $621. Now, we subtract the total cost of the toys from her initial amount: 622 - 621 = $1. Vanessa would have $1 left after buying as many toys as she could. The answer is 1.

Q: Faye was cutting out some fabric for a friend. She cut a piece that was 3 centimeters wide and had an area of 24 square centimeters. How long was the piece?
A:Let's think step by step
To find the length of the piece, we need to use the formula for area, which is Area = Width × Length. In this case, the area is 24 square centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters. To find the length, we can rearrange the formula to Length = Area / Width. So, the length is 24 / 3 = 8 centimeters. The answer is 8.
