Question: Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. How many apples does Bob have?
A: Let's think step by step
Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples.
Let's assume Jackie has x apples. Since Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie, Adam has x + 4 apples.
Together they have x + (x + 4) = 14 apples. 
So, 2x + 4 = 14.
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2x = 10.
Dividing by 2, we get x = 5.
Jackie has 5 apples. Adam, who has 4 more than Jackie, has 5 + 4 = 9 apples.
Together Adam and Jackie have 14 apples. Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do, which is 14 + 6 = 20 apples.
Therefore, Bob has 20 apples.
The answer is 20.

Question: Jerry had 7 action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added some more action figures to the shelf and removed 10 of the old ones. If there are 8 action figures on his shelf now How many action figures did he add to the shelf?
A: Let's think step by step
Jerry had 7 action figures on the shelf initially. He added some more action figures and removed 10 of the old ones. Now, there are 8 action figures on the shelf.
First, let's determine the total number of action figures on the shelf before he added more and removed some:
7 (initial action figures) + X (action figures added) - 10 (action figures removed) = 8 (current action figures)
To find X, we can set up the equation:
7 + X - 10 = 8
Simplify the equation:
X - 3 = 8
Solve for X:
X = 11
Therefore, Jerry added 11 action figures to the shelf.
The answer is 11.

Question: Danny collects bottle caps. He found 63 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 51 old ones. Now he has 33 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
A: Let's think step by step
Danny found 63 bottle caps at the park and threw away 51 old ones, ending up with 33 bottle caps in his collection. To find how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to account for the ones he threw away and the ones he found.
Let's denote the number of bottle caps Danny had at first as "x."
He threw away 51 old bottle caps, so he must have had "x - 51" bottle caps after throwing them away.
He then found 63 bottle caps at the park, so his new total should be "x - 51 + 63."
This total is given as 33, so we set up the equation:
x - 51 + 63 = 33
Solving for x:
x + 12 = 33
x = 33 - 12
x = 21
Therefore, Danny had 21 bottle caps at first.
The answer is 21.

Question: 5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?
A: Let's think step by step
To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we first need to determine how many children got on the bus. 
Initially, there were 5 children on the bus. 63 children got off the bus. Let��s denote the number of children that got on the bus as \( x \). After these events, there were 14 children on the bus.
So, the equation for the remaining children on the bus can be formulated as:
5 - 63 + \( x \) = 14
Solving for \( x \):
5 - 63 + \( x \) = 14
-58 + \( x \) = 14
\( x \) = 14 + 58
\( x \) = 72
Therefore, 72 children got on the bus. Now, we need to find the difference between the number of children who got on the bus and the number who got off the bus:
72 - 63 = 9
So, 9 more children got on the bus than those that got off.
The answer is 9.

Question: Danny collects bottle caps. He threw away 60 of the old ones at the park while he found 58 bottle caps new ones. Now he has 67 bottle caps in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
A: Let's think step by step
Danny threw away 60 bottle caps and found 58 new ones. Now he has 67 bottle caps in his collection.
Let the number of bottle caps Danny had at first be denoted as x.
After throwing away 60 and finding 58 new ones, he would have:
x - 60 + 58
According to the problem, this equals to 67:
x - 60 + 58 = 67
Simplifying the equation:
x - 2 = 67
Adding 2 to both sides:
x = 67 + 2
x = 69
Therefore, Danny had 69 bottle caps at first.
The answer is 69.

Question: Robin has some packages of gum. There are 7 pieces in each package. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. In all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41. How many packages does Robin have?
A: Let's think step by step
Let's denote the number of packages Robin has as P.
Each package has 7 pieces of gum, so the total number of pieces from the packages is 7P.
Robin also has 6 extra pieces of gum.
In total, Robin has 41 pieces of gum. 
So, the equation becomes:
7P + 6 = 41
To find P, we need to solve the equation:
7P + 6 = 41
7P = 41 - 6
7P = 35
P = 35 / 7
P = 5
Therefore, Robin has 5 packages of gum.
The answer is 5.

Question: Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 11 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 4 peaches. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?
A: Let's think step by step
Steven has 4 peaches. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 4 - 12 = -8 peaches.
However, having a negative number of peaches doesn't make sense in this context, which prompts us to re-examine the problem:
Steven, who has 4 peaches, actually must have 11 more peaches than Jill because it's stated that Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill. Therefore, Jill has 4 - 11 = -7 peaches. Again, this seems incorrect in context.
Let's instead interpret the description correctly:
Given:
Steven has 15 peaches.
Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill.
So, Jill has 4 - 11 = -7 peaches.
Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, therefore Jake has 4 - 12 = -8 peaches.
Trying again for clarity:
Jake has -8 peaches.
Jill has -7 peaches.
How many more peaches Jill has:
Jill(-7) - Jake(-8)
=-7-(-8)=1
Therefore, Jill has 1 more peach than Jake.
The answer is 1.

Question: Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?
A: Let's think step by step
Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J.
We are given the following information:
1. Adam and Jackie together have 12 apples: A + J = 12
2. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together: H = A + J + 9
3. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie: A = J + 8
First, substitute the value of A from the third equation into the first equation:
(J + 8) + J = 12
2J + 8 = 12
2J = 12 - 8
2J = 4
J = 2
Now, substitute the value of J back into the third equation to find A:
A = J + 8
A = 2 + 8
A = 10
Next, use the value of A + J to find H:
H = A + J + 9
H = 10 + 2 + 9
H = 21
Therefore, He has 21 apples.
The answer is 21.
