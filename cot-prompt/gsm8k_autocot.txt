Q: Peter has to walk 2.5 miles to get to the grocery store. If it takes him 20 minutes to walk one mile and he has walked 1 mile already, how many more minutes does he have to walk to reach it?
A:Let's think step by step
Peter has to walk a remaining 2.5 total miles - 1 mile completed = <<2.5-1=1.5>>1.5 miles remaining
It will take him another 20 minutes * 1.5 miles remaining = <<20*1.5=30>>30 minutes to get to the grocery store
The answer is 30.

Q: Sandra had 2 different bags of candy.  Each of her bags had 6 pieces of candy left.  Her brother, Roger, also had 2 bags of candy.  One of his bags of candy had 11 pieces left and the other had 3 pieces left.  How much more candy did Roger have?
A:Let's think step by step
Sandra had 2 bags that each contained 6 pieces of candy so 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 pieces
Roger had 11 pieces of candy in one bag and 3 pieces in the other so 11+3 = <<11+3=14>>14 pieces
Roger had 14 pieces and Sandra had 12 pieces so Roger has 14-12 = <<14-12=2>>2 more pieces of candy
The answer is 2.

Q: At the bookstore, Sarah bought 6 paperback books and 4 hardback books. Her brother bought one-third as many paperback books as Sarah bought, and two times the number of hardback books that she bought. How many books did her brother buy in total?
A:Let's think step by step
Her brother bought 6/3=<<6/3=2>>2 paperbacks
He bought 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hardbacks
In total he bought 2+8=<<2+8=10>>10 books
The answer is 10.

Q: Bill had to finish a project from work that was to take him 4 days. If he took 6 seven-hour naps in the four days, how long did he spend working on the project?
A:Let's think step by step
Since a day has 24 hours, the project was to take 24*4 = <<24*4=96>>96 hours.
Bill took 6 seven-hour naps during the four days, a total of 6*7 = <<6*7=42>>42 hours
The time he spent working on the project is 96-42 = <<96-42=54>>54 hours.
The answer is 54.

Q: Annie went to a liquidation sale and bought 5 televisions that each cost $50. She also purchased 10 figurines. If Annie spent $260 in total, how much did a single figurine cost in dollars?
A:Let's think step by step
Annie spent 5 * $50 = $<<5*50=250>>250 on televisions.
She has $260 - $250 = $<<260-250=10>>10 left for the 10 figurines.
A single figurine costs $10/10=$1.
The answer is 1.

Q: Three years ago, Bethany was twice the age of her younger sister. In 5 years, her younger sister will be 16. How old is Bethany now?
A:Let's think step by step
First find how old Bethany's sister currently is: 16 years - 5 years = <<16-5=11>>11 years
Then find how old her sister was 3 years ago: 11 years - 3 years = <<11-3=8>>8 years
Then double that age to find how old Bethany was three years ago: 8 years * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years
Then add 3 years to that number to find how old Bethany is now: 16 years + 3 years = <<16+3=19>>19 years
The answer is 19.

Q: Monica is a teacher. She has 6 classes per day. The first class has 20 students. The second and third classes have 25 students. Her fourth class has half as many as her first class. Her fifth and sixth classes have 28 students. How many students does Monica see each day?
A:Let's think step by step
Monica has 20+25+25+28+28=<<20+25+25+28+28=126>>126 in 5 of her classes.
In the fourth class, she has 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 students.
In total, she has 126+10=<<126+10=136>>136 students per day.
The answer is 136.

Q: John's neighbor tells him to walk his dog for 1 hour each day for a total of $10. He does this for April, save for the 4 Sundays in April. He later spent $50 on books and gave his sister Kaylee the same amount. How much money did John have left?
A:Let's think step by step
April has 30 days, so if he didn't walk the dog on Sundays, he worked for a total of 30 days - 4 days = <<30-4=26>>26 days.
If each day he earned $10, he ends up with 26 days * $10/day = $<<26*10=260>>260 .
After buying books and giving his sister $50, he ends up with $260 - $50 - $50 = $<<260-50-50=160>>160
The answer is 160.
