The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem. 
The problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. 
The task is to use the given premises to verify whether the conclusion is True, False, or Uncertain.

<PREMISES>
All young adults at the event like independence.
All college students at the event are young adults.
All Yale students at the event are college students.
Everyone at the event is a Yale student or a Harvard student.
All Harvard students at the event are diligent.
Susan is at the event, and if Susan is a Harvard student, then she is a young adult.
If Susan is a Yale student, then she does not like independence.
</PREMISES>
<CONCLUSION>
Susan is a college student.
</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>
Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if Susan is a college student.
1. From the premises, we know that everyone at the event is either a Yale student or a Harvard student.
2. If Susan is a Yale student, then she does not like independence. However, we know that all young adults at the event like independence, and all college students at the event are young adults. Therefore, if Susan does not like independence, she cannot be a young adult, and therefore she cannot be a college student.
3. If Susan is a Harvard student, she must be diligent and a young adult. Since all college students at the event are young adults, if Susan is a Harvard student, she must also be a college student.
4. Therefore, if Susan is a Harvard student, she is a college student. If she is a Yale student, she is not a college student. Since the premises do not provide enough information to determine whether Susan is a Harvard student or a Yale student, the conclusion that Susan is a college student is Uncertain.

Some students in the class who are good at math are also good at chemistry.
All students in the class who are good at chemistry enjoy conducting experiments. 
All students in the class that enjoy conducting experiments are good at planning. 
None of the students who are good at planning failed the class.
James is a student in the class; he is either good at chemistry and failed the class, or bad at chemistry and passed the class.
</PREMISES>
<CONCLUSION>
James failed the class and is good at math.
</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>
Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if James failed the class and is good at math.
1. From the premises, some students in the class who are good at math are also good at chemistry. This does not mean all students good at math are good at chemistry, so we can't immediately infer James's math skills based on chemistry.
2. All students in the class who are good at chemistry enjoy conducting experiments. If James is good at chemistry, then he would enjoy conducting experiments.
3. All students in the class that enjoy conducting experiments are good at planning. If James enjoys conducting experiments, then he is good at planning.
4. None of the students who are good at planning failed the class. This means if James is good at planning, he cannot have failed the class.
5. James is either good at chemistry and failed the class, or bad at chemistry and passed the class. If James is good at chemistry and failed, it contradicts the premise that students good at planning (which James would be if he were good at chemistry) did not fail. Therefore, James cannot be both good at chemistry and have failed the class.
Given this, the conclusion that James failed the class and is good at math cannot be definitively supported by the premises, and there are contradictions in the premises that make it impossible to conclude this.

The Blake McFall Company Building is a building added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
The Emmet Building is a five-story building in Portland, Oregon.
The Emmet Building was built in 1915.
The Emmet Building is another name for the Blake McFall Company Building.
John works at the Emmet Building.
</PREMISES>
<CONCLUSION>
The Blake McFall Company Building is located in Portland, Oregon.
</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>
Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Blake McFall Company Building is located in Portland, Oregon.
1. The Blake McFall Company Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. This provides information about its historical status but not its location.
2. The Emmet Building is a five-story building in Portland, Oregon. This gives us information about the location of the Emmet Building.
3. The Emmet Building was built in 1915. Again, this tells us the construction date but not directly about the Blake McFall Company Building.
4. The Emmet Building is another name for the Blake McFall Company Building. This premise directly connects the two buildings, indicating that they are the same.
5. John works at the Emmet Building. This tells us about John's workplace but is not directly relevant to the conclusion.
Given that the Emmet Building is located in Portland, Oregon, and the Emmet Building is the same as the Blake McFall Company Building, it follows logically that the Blake McFall Company Building is also located in Portland, Oregon.

There are eight federal districts of Russia: Central, Northwestern, Southern, North Caucasian, Volga, Ural, Siberian, and Far Eastern.
The Central federal district has the largest population among all federal districts in Russia.
Moscow is the administrative center of the Central federal district.
Yekaterinburg is the administrative center of the Ural federal district.
Vladivostok is the administrative center of the Far Eastern federal district.
The Far Eastern federal district has the largest area among all federal districts in Russia.
Some federal districts in Russia were established in 2000.
</PREMISES>
<CONCLUSION>
The Northwestern federal district was established in 2000.
</CONCLUSION>
<EVALUATE>
Let's think step by step. We want to evaluate if the Northwestern federal district was established in 2000.
1. There are eight federal districts of Russia listed, including the Northwestern federal district.
2. Some federal districts in Russia were established in 2000. However, this does not specify which districts were established in that year.
3. We know that the Central federal district has the largest population, and other districts have specific administrative centers and area rankings. However, this information does not relate to the establishment year of the federal districts.
4. We do not have specific information about the establishment years of individual federal districts except for the fact that some were established in 2000.
Given the information provided, we cannot determine whether the Northwestern federal district was established in 2000. Therefore, the conclusion that the Northwestern federal district was established in 2000 is **Uncertain**.
