Question: Rob has seven quarters, three dimes, five nickels, and twelve pennies. How much money does Rob have?
A:  Let's think step by step
To find out how much money Rob has, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. Quarters: Rob has 7 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. So, 7 quarters are worth 7 * $0.25 = $1.75.
2. Dimes: Rob has 3 dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10. So, 3 dimes are worth 3 * $0.10 = $0.30.
3. Nickels: Rob has 5 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05. So, 5 nickels are worth 5 * $0.05 = $0.25.
4. Pennies: Rob has 12 pennies. Each penny is worth $0.01. So, 12 pennies are worth 12 * $0.01 = $0.12.

Now, we sum up the values of all the coins: $1.75 + $0.30 + $0.25 + $0.12 = $2.42. Rob has $2.42 in total. 
The answer is $2.42.

Question: Mrs. Greer and Mrs. Doyle took polls of their second-grade classes to find out their students' favorite colors. In Mrs. Greer's class, 8 students said their favorite color was blue and 14 said their favorite color was red. In Mrs. Doyle's class, 10 voted for blue and 13 for red. Whose class had a higher ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red?
A: Let's think step by step
First, let's find the ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red in each class.
In Mrs. Greer's class:
Blue: 8 students
Red: 14 students
Ratio: 8/14 = 0.5714

In Mrs. Doyle's class:
Blue: 10 students
Red: 13 students
Ratio: 10/13 = 0.7692

Now, let's compare the ratios:
Mrs. Greer's class ratio: 0.5714
Mrs. Doyle's class ratio: 0.7692

Since 0.7692 (Mrs. Doyle's class) is greater than 0.5714 (Mrs. Greer's class), Mrs. Doyle's class had a higher ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red. The answer is Mrs. Doyle's class.
The answer is Mrs. Doyle's class.

Question: Destiny just received two separate gifts from her great-great-grandmother. The first gift is a box of 18 chocolate candy bars, and the second gift is a pack of 12 cookies. Destiny wants to use all of the chocolate candy bars and cookies to make identical snack bags for her cousins.What is the greatest number of snack bags that Destiny can make?
A: Let's think step by step
To determine the greatest number of identical snack bags Destiny can make using all of the chocolate candy bars and cookies, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers: 18 chocolate candy bars and 12 cookies.
Step-by-Step Calculation of GCD
1. Prime Factorization:
8 = 2 *3^2 
12 = 2^2 *3
2. Identify the Common Prime Factors:
The common prime factors are 2 and  3 .
The lowest power of these common primes:
For 2 , the minimum power is 2^1 .
For  3 , the minimum power is3^1 .
3. Calculate the GCD:
GCD = 2^1 * 3^1 = 2 * 3 = 6
Number of Snack Bags
The GCD of 18 and 12 is 6. This means that the greatest number of identical snack bags Destiny can make is 6.
Distributing the Snacks
Each of the 6 snack bags will contain:
Number of chocolate candy bars per bag:
18/6=3
Number of cookies per bag:
12/6=2
Therefore, the greatest number of snack bags that Destiny can make is 6
The answer is 6.

Question: Kevin started his science test at 2:34 p.m. and finished the test 75 minutes later. Kevin has football practice at 4:15 p.m. How much time did Kevin have between the end of the test and the beginning of football practice?
A: Let's think step by step
First, we need to find out when Kevin finished his test. He started at 2:34 p.m. and finished 75 minutes later. To find the end time, we can add 75 minutes to 2:34 p.m.
75 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour and 15 minutes. So, we add 1 hour to 2:34 p.m., which gives us 3:34 p.m. Then, we add the remaining 15 minutes to 3:34 p.m., which gives us 3:49 p.m.
Now, we need to find the time difference between 3:49 p.m. and Kevin's football practice at 4:15 p.m.
From 3:49 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. is 11 minutes. From 4:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. is 15 minutes. So, the total time difference is 11 + 15 = 26 minutes.
Kevin had 26 minutes between the end of the test and the beginning of football practice. The answer is 26.
The answer is 26 (minutes).

Question: Mrs. Greer and Mrs. Doyle took polls of their second-grade classes to find out their students' favorite colors. In Mrs. Greer's class, 8 students said their favorite color was blue and 14 said their favorite color was red. In Mrs. Doyle's class, 10 voted for blue and 13 for red.Whose class had a higher ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red?
A: Let's think step by step
To determine which class had a higher ratio of students who preferred blue to those who preferred red, we need to calculate the ratios for both classes and compare them.
Mrs. Greer's Class
Number of students who preferred blue: 8
Number of students who preferred red: 14
The ratio of students who preferred blue to those who preferred red in Mrs. Greer's class is:
Ratio (Mrs. Greer's class) = 8/14 = 4/7
Mrs. Doyle's Class
Number of students who preferred blue: 10
Number of students who preferred red: 13
The ratio of students who preferred blue to those who preferred red in Mrs. Doyle's class is:
Ratio (Mrs. Doyle's class) =10/13
Comparing the Ratios
To compare the fractions 4/7  and 10/13, we can find a common denominator or compare their decimal equivalents.
1. Finding the decimal equivalents:
4/7 = 0.5714
10/13=0.7692
2. Comparing the values:
0.5714 < 0.7692
Since 0.7692 (Mrs. Doyle's class) is greater than0.5714 (Mrs. Greer's class), Mrs. Doyle's class has a higher ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red.
Thus, Mrs. Doyle's class had the higher ratio of students who preferred blue to students who preferred red. 
The answer is Mrs. Doyle's class.

Question: Susan started her homework at 1:59 p.m. and finished her homework 96 minutes later. Susan had volleyball practice at 4:00 p.m. How much time did Susan have between finishing her homework and the beginning of volleyball practice?
A: Let's think step by step
First, we need to determine when Susan finished her homework. She started at 1:59 p.m. and finished 96 minutes later. 
To find the end time, we can add 96 minutes to 1:59 p.m.:
1:59 p.m. + 1 hour (60 minutes) = 2:59 p.m.
2:59 p.m. + 36 minutes = 3:35 p.m.
So, Susan finished her homework at 3:35 p.m.
Now, we need to find the time between finishing her homework and the beginning of volleyball practice at 4:00 p.m.
4:00 p.m. - 3:35 p.m. = 25 minutes
Susan had 25 minutes between finishing her homework and the beginning of volleyball practice. The answer is 25.
The answer is 25.

Question: Mrs. Wilson, the math teacher, has 18 logic puzzles and 9 visual puzzles that she wants to group into sets for students who finish their tests early. Mrs. Wilson wants each set to be identical, containing the same combination of logic puzzles and visual puzzles, with no puzzles left over.What is the greatest number of sets she can create?
A: Let's think step by step
To determine the greatest number of identical sets Mrs. Wilson can create using all of the logic puzzles and visual puzzles, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers: 18 logic puzzles and 9 visual puzzles.
Step-by-Step Calculation of GCD
1. Prime Factorization:
18 = 2 * 3^2
9 = 3^2
2. Identify the Common Prime Factors:
The common prime factor is 3.
The lowest power of this common prime factor is 3^2 .
3. Calculate the GCD:
GCD = 3^2 = 9
Number of Sets
The GCD of 18 and 9 is 9. This means that the greatest number of identical sets that can be created is 9.
Distributing the Puzzles
Each of the 9 sets will contain:
Number of logic puzzles per set:
18/9=2
Number of visual puzzles per set:
9/9=1
Therefore, the greatest number of sets that Mrs. Wilson can create is 9.
The answer is 9.

Question: If you were to travel by metro the fare for the first kilometer is different from the rate per kilometer for the remaining distance. The total fare for a distance of 20 km is $37.70 and that for a distance of 26 km is $48.50. Find the auto fare for the first kilometer and for each successive kilometer.
A: Let's think step by Step
To find the auto fare for the first kilometer and for each successive kilometer, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.
Let x be the fare for the first kilometer, and y be the fare for each successive kilometer.
For a distance of 20 km:
x + 19y = $37.70 (Equation 1)

For a distance of 26 km:
x + 25y = $48.50 (Equation 2)

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.
First, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:
(x + 25y) - (x + 19y) = $48.50 - $37.70
6y = $10.80
y = $1.80

Now, substitute the value of y back into Equation 1:
x + 19($1.80) = $37.70
x + $34.20 = $37.70
x = $3.50

So, the auto fare for the first kilometer is $3.50, and the fare for each successive kilometer is $1.80.
