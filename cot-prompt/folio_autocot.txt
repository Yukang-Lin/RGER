Q: The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.
The problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.
Here are premises:
No professional basketball players are soccer players.
All NBA players are professional basketball players.
All soccer defenders are soccer players.
All centerbacks are soccer defenders.
Roger Federer is either both an NBA player and a soccer defender, or neither.
Based on these premises, verify whether the conclusion 'Roger Federer is a soccer player.' is True, False, or Uncertain.
A:Let's think step by step
First, let’s write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.
#1. No professional basketball players are soccer players.
#2. All NBA players are professional basketball players.
#3. All soccer defenders are soccer players.
#4. All centerbacks are soccer defenders.
#5. Roger Federer is either both an NBA player and a soccer defender, or neither.
Next, let’s answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process: 
#6. (by #1 #2) Step 1: Analyze the relationship between professional basketball players and soccer players.
- No professional basketball players are soccer players.
- All NBA players are professional basketball players.
- Therefore, no NBA players are soccer players.
#7. (by #3 #4) Step 2: Analyze the relationship between centerbacks and soccer players.
- All centerbacks are soccer defenders.
- All soccer defenders are soccer players.
- Therefore, all centerbacks are soccer players.
#8. (by #5) Step 3: Analyze the status of Roger Federer.
- Roger Federer is either both an NBA player and a soccer defender, or neither.
#9. (by #6 #7) Step 4: Verify the conclusion.
The conclusion states, "Roger Federer is a soccer player."
- Since Roger Federer can either be both an NBA player and a soccer defender or neither, and we have no further information about his status as an NBA player or soccer defender, it is uncertain if Roger Federer is a soccer player or not.
Therefore, the conclusion "Roger Federer is a soccer player" is Uncertain.

Q: The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.
The problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.
Here are premises:
All young working professionals who have regular 9-5 jobs have stable jobs.
Some people living in Manhattan are young professionals with regular 9-5 jobs.
All people who have stable jobs are people who work regularly.
People who work regularly do not frequently disobey their bosses.
Mary either frequently disobeys her bosses and works regularly, or that she neither frequently disobeys her bosses nor works regularly.
Based on these premises, verify whether the conclusion 'If Mary is a young working professional who has a regular 9-5 job, then Mary does not live in Manhattan.' is True, False, or Uncertain.
A:Let's think step by step
First, let’s write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.
#1. All young working professionals who have regular 9-5 jobs have stable jobs.
#2. Some people living in Manhattan are young professionals with regular 9-5 jobs.
#3. All people who have stable jobs are people who work regularly.
#4. People who work regularly do not frequently disobey their bosses.
#5. Mary either frequently disobeys her bosses and works regularly, or she neither frequently disobeys her bosses nor works regularly.
Next, let’s answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:
#6. (by #1 #3) Step 1: Analyze the relationship between young professionals, stable jobs, and regular work.
- All young working professionals who have regular 9-5 jobs have stable jobs.
- All people who have stable jobs are people who work regularly.
- Therefore, all young working professionals who have regular 9-5 jobs work regularly.
#7. (by #4) Step 2: Analyze the relationship between regular work and disobeying bosses.
- People who work regularly do not frequently disobey their bosses.
- Therefore, young working professionals who have regular 9-5 jobs do not frequently disobey their bosses.
#8. (by #5) Step 3: Analyze Mary's behavior.
- Mary either frequently disobeys her bosses and works regularly, or she neither frequently disobeys her bosses nor works regularly.
- Given that people who work regularly do not frequently disobey their bosses, the first part of the disjunction (frequently disobeys and works regularly) is contradictory.
- Therefore, Mary must neither frequently disobey her bosses nor work regularly.
#9. (by #2) Step 4: Analyze the population in Manhattan.
- Some people living in Manhattan are young professionals with regular 9-5 jobs.
- This means there are young professionals with regular 9-5 jobs in Manhattan.
#10. (by #6 #8) Step 5: Verify the conclusion.
The conclusion states, "If Mary is a young working professional who has a regular 9-5 job, then Mary does not live in Manhattan."
- If Mary is a young working professional who has a regular 9-5 job, she must work regularly and not frequently disobey her bosses.
- However, we have established that Mary neither frequently disobeys her bosses nor works regularly, which means she cannot be a young working professional with a regular 9-5 job.
- Since Mary cannot be a young working professional with a regular 9-5 job, the antecedent of the conclusion is false, making the implication true by default.
Therefore, the conclusion "If Mary is a young working professional who has a regular 9-5 job, then Mary does not live in Manhattan" is True.
