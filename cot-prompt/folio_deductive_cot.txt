Q: The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.
The problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.
Here are premises:
All red fruits that grow in Ben's yard contain some Vitamin C. 
All apples that grow in Ben's yard are red fruits. 
All fruits that grow in Ben's yard and contain some Vitamin C are healthy. 
No fruits that grow in Ben's yard and are healthy are on a warning list. 
The cherries grow in Ben's yard. 
If cherries are not apples and are not healthy, then they are red fruits.
Based on these premises, verify whether the conclusion 'If the cherries are either healthy or are on a warning list, then they are not red.' is True, False, or Uncertain.
A: First, let’s write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.
#1. All red fruits that grow in Ben's yard contain some Vitamin C.
#2. All apples that grow in Ben's yard are red fruits.
#3. All fruits that grow in Ben's yard and contain some Vitamin C are healthy.
#4. No fruits that grow in Ben's yard and are healthy are on a warning list.
#5. The cherries grow in Ben's yard.
#6. If cherries are not apples and are not healthy, then they are red fruits.
Next, let’s answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:
#7. (by #1 #3) Step 1: Analyze the relationship between red fruits, Vitamin C, and healthiness.
- All red fruits that grow in Ben's yard contain some Vitamin C.
- All fruits that grow in Ben's yard and contain some Vitamin C are healthy.
- Therefore, all red fruits that grow in Ben's yard are healthy.
#8. (by #4) Step 2: Analyze the relationship between healthiness and the warning list.
- No fruits that grow in Ben's yard and are healthy are on a warning list.
- Therefore, if a fruit is healthy, it cannot be on the warning list.
#9. (by #5) Step 3: Analyze the status of cherries.
- The cherries grow in Ben's yard.
#10. (by #6 #8) Step 4: Analyze the conditions given for cherries.
- If cherries are not apples and are not healthy, then they are red fruits.
- If cherries are healthy, then they are not on the warning list.
#11. (by #8 #7) Step 5: Consider the case if cherries are healthy.
- If cherries are healthy, they cannot be on the warning list.
- Since all red fruits that grow in Ben's yard are healthy, if cherries are red, they must be healthy.
- If cherries are healthy, they are not on the warning list, contradicting the initial part of the conclusion.
#13. (by #8 #6) Step 7: Consider the case if cherries are on the warning list.
- If cherries are on the warning list, they are not healthy.
- If cherries are not healthy and they are not apples, then they are red fruits.
#14. (by #7 #6) Step 8: Verify the combination of scenarios.
- If cherries are either healthy or on a warning list, then according to our analysis:
  - If healthy, they are red.
  - If on the warning list, they are red.
Therefore, in both cases (either healthy or on the warning list), the cherries being red contradicts the conclusion that they are not red.
Thus, the conclusion "If the cherries are either healthy or are on a warning list, then they are not red" is False.

Q: The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.
The problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.
Here are premises:
All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine. 
People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine, or both. 
No one who doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug. 
Rina is either a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or she is not a student and is she aware that caffeine is a drug. 
Rina is either a student who is dependent on caffeine, or she is not a student and not dependent on caffeine.
Based on these premises, verify whether the conclusion 'Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug.' is True, False, or Uncertain.
A: First, let’s write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.
#1. All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.
#2. People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine, or both.
#3. No one who doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine is unaware that caffeine is a drug.
#4. Rina is either a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug, or she is not a student and is she aware that caffeine is a drug.
#5. Rina is either a student who is dependent on caffeine, or she is not a student and not dependent on caffeine.
Next, let’s answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:
#6. (by #1 #5) Step 1: Analyze Rina's dependency on caffeine.
If Rina is a student who is dependent on caffeine, she must regularly drink coffee.
#7. (by #3 #4) Step 2: Analyze Rina's awareness of caffeine being a drug.
If Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine, she must be aware that caffeine is a drug.
If Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug, she must want to be addicted to caffeine.
#8. (by #5 #7 ) Step 3: Combine Rina's possible scenarios.
- If Rina is a student who is unaware that caffeine is a drug, then she must want to be addicted to caffeine.
- If Rina is not a student and is aware that caffeine is a drug, then she must not want to be addicted to caffeine.
#9. (by #4) Step 4: Verify the conclusion.
The conclusion states, "Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug."
- If Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine, the conclusion is true.
- If Rina is unaware that caffeine is a drug, the conclusion is also true.
Therefore, regardless of Rina's status as a student or non-student, the conclusion "Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug" is always true.
Therefore, the conclusion is True.

Q: The following is a first-order logic (FOL) problem.
The problem is to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.
Here are premises:
The Blake McFall Company Building is a building added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. 
The Emmet Building is a five-story building in Portland, Oregon. 
The Emmet Building was built in 1915. 
The Emmet Building is another name for the Blake McFall Company Building. 
John works at the Emmet Building.
Based on these premises, verify whether the conclusion 'John started his current job in 1990.' is True, False, or Uncertain.
A: First, let’s write down all the statements and relationships in the question with labels.
#1. The Blake McFall Company Building is a building added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
#2. The Emmet Building is a five-story building in Portland, Oregon.
#3. The Emmet Building was built in 1915.
#4. The Emmet Building is another name for the Blake McFall Company Building.
#5. John works at the Emmet Building.
Next, let’s answer the question step by step with reference to the question and reasoning process:
#6. (by #1 #4) Step 1: Identify the Emmet Building.
The Emmet Building is the same as the Blake McFall Company Building.
#7. (by #1) Step 2: Identify the historical status of the building.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
#8. (by #5) Step 3: Analyze John's employment.
John works at the Emmet Building (Blake McFall Company Building).
#9. (by #1 #5) Step 4: Verify the conclusion.
The conclusion states, "John started his current job in 1990."
- The premises do not provide any information about when John started his job at the Emmet Building.
- The premises only state that John works at the Emmet Building and that the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.
Therefore, the conclusion "John started his current job in 1990" is Uncertain.
